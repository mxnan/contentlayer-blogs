## Steps

There are only 3 steps to achieve this effect:

1. Encode the video into a specific format
2. Render the video using any video player
3. Sync the time of video with the scroll position

### Step 1: Encode the video

We need to encode the video in such format that each frame can be seeked given a timestamp. We can use ffmpeg to encode the video. Here is the command to encode the video:

```app/layout.tsx
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -movflags faststart -vcodec libx264 -crf 23 -g 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p output_video.mp4
```

### Step 2: Render the video

We can use any video player to render the video. For this example, we will use the `video` tag in html.

```app/page.tsx
<video loop muted playsInline ref={videoRef}>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

### Step 3: Sync the time

We can use framer-motion to sync the time of video with the scroll position. Here is the code to achieve this effect:

```tsx
useMotionValueEvent(scrollY, "change", (latest) => {
    const video = videoRef.current;
    const timestamp = ...; // calculate the time based on the scroll position
    video.currentTime = timestamp;
});
```

I've skipped the implementation of `useMotionValueEvent` and calculation of `timestamp` for brevity. There are many ways to achieve this effect. Even you can achieve this effect without using any library. The key is to calculate the time based on the scroll position and set the `currentTime` of video accordingly.

You can find the complete code in the [github repo](https://github.com/rudrodip/on-scroll-playback).

## Optimization

Here's a few tips to optimize the performance & user experience:

1. Use a better video player rather than the default video tag. In react/nextjs, the default video tag sometimes misbehaves.
2. Use HLS streaming for better performance.
3. Host the video in a CDN for faster loading.
