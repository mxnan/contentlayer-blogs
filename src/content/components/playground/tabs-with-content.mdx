# Tabs

We see a lot of modern websites e.g. [Apple](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro), [Frame.io](https://frame.io) where the video playback is synced with the scroll position.

Let's see how we can achieve this effect using ffmpeg, framer-motion & nextjs.

Before we start, let's see a [demo](https://on-scroll-playback.vercel.app) of the effect we are going to achieve. You may need to refresh the page (this is a foreshadowing of an optimization we will discuss later in this article)
